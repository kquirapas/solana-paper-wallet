Paper is a web application built on Solana for decoupling your balance from your Keypair Wallets using a hash and seed phrase.

Keep your Solana in your physical wallet, but make sure you secure your credentials.

## License

WIP

## Original Idea

This idea of a paper wallet came from the **Blockchain Whisperer**. He implemented one in Ethereum with ERC20s, so I decided to make one for Solana.
